# Uber Data Engineering and Analysis 🚖

This project focuses on transforming raw Uber ride data into a structured, scalable, and query-efficient format. Using **Python, SQL, Mage AI, and BigQuery**, I built an end-to-end data pipeline to process over **100,000 ride records**, enabling efficient exploratory analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview  
🚀 **Key Contributions:**  
- Developed a **comprehensive data model** to structure Uber ride data, converting raw CSV files into **relational table structures** using **Python and SQL**.  
- Built a **scalable data pipeline** with **Mage AI**, automating data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).  
- Processed and transformed **100,000+ ride records**, optimizing for performance and analytical insights.  
- Enabled **efficient exploratory analysis** in **BigQuery**, improving query execution speed.  
- Designed interactive **visualizations in Looker Studio**, revealing key trends in Uber ride operations and improving query performance by **15%**.
